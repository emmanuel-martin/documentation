## Inclusion

An inclusive brand puts people first by prioritizing respectful communication and presenting content and functionality in ways that everyone can access and understand.

To help you design an inclusive brand, consider the following goals as you review the words and images you use and the experiences you offer.

As with all design, designing an inclusive brand is an iterative process that takes time to get right. Throughout the process, be prepared to examine your assumptions about how other people think and feel and be open to evolving knowledge and understanding.

### Inclusive by design

Simple, intuitive experiences are at the core of well-designed brands. To design an intuitive experience, you start by investigating people’s goals and perspectives so you can present content that resonates with them.

Empathy is an important tool in this investigation because it helps you understand how people with different perspectives might respond to the content and experiences you create. For example, you might discover that from some perspectives a word or image in your brand is incomprehensible or has a meaning you don’t intend.

Although each person’s perspective comprises a unique intersection of human qualities that’s both distinct and dynamic, all perspectives arise from human characteristics and experiences that everyone shares, including:

- Age

- Gender and gender identity

- Race and ethnicity

- Sexuality

- Physical attributes

- Cognitive attributes

- Permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities

- Language and culture

- Religion

- Education

- Political or philosophical opinions

- Social and economic context

As you examine your brand through different perspectives, avoid framing the work as merely a search for content that might give offense. Although no brand should contain offensive material or experiences, an inoffensive brand isn’t necessarily an inclusive brand. Focusing on inclusion can help you avoid potentially offensive content while also helping you create a welcoming experience that everyone can enjoy.

### Welcome Language

Using plain, inclusive language welcomes everyone and helps them understand your app. Carefully review the writing in your app to make sure that your tone and words don’t exclude people. Here are a few tips for writing text — also known as copy — that’s direct, easy to understand, and inclusive.

Consider the tone of your copy from different perspectives. The style of your writing communicates almost as much as the words you use. Although different apps use different communication styles, make sure the tone you use doesn’t send messages you don’t intend. For example, an academic tone can make an app seem like it welcomes only high levels of education. As you seek the style that’s right for your app, focus on being clear, direct, and respectful.

Pay attention to how you refer to people. It typically works well to use you and your to address people directly. Referring to people indirectly as users or the user can make your app feel distant and unwelcoming. Also, consider reserving words like we and our to represent your app or company; otherwise, these terms can suggest a personal relationship with people that might be interpreted as insulting or condescending.

Avoid using specialized or technical terms without defining them. Using specialized or technical terms can make your writing more succinct, but doing so excludes people who don’t know what the terms mean. If you must use such terms, be sure to define them first and make the definitions easy for people to look up. Even when people know the definition of a specialized or technical term in a sentence, the sentence is easier to read — and translate — when it uses plain language instead.

Replace colloquial expressions with plain language. Colloquial expressions are often culture-specific and can be difficult to translate. Worse, some colloquial phrases have exclusionary meanings you might not know. For example, the phrases peanut gallery and grandfathered in both arose from oppressive contexts and continue to exclude people. Even when a colloquial phrase doesn’t have an exclusionary meaning, it can still exclude everyone who doesn’t understand it.

Consider carefully before including humor. Humor is highly subjective and — similar to colloquial expressions — difficult to translate from one culture to another. Including humor in your app risks confusing people who donʼt understand it, irritating people who tire of repeatedly encountering it, and insulting people who interpret it differently.
